      # About Asciinema

      Asciinema (formerly ascii.io) is a free and open source solution for
      recording the terminal sessions and sharing them on the web.

      It aims to be a "go to" place for every command-line user who wants to share
      his skills with others. Or putting it differently, it's a place to show off
      your geekiness.

      The Asciinema project is built of 2 sub-projects:

      * a command-line based terminal session recorder, `asciinema` ([source code](https://github.com/sickill/asciinema)),
      * a website with an API and a player at asciinema.org ([source code](https://github.com/sickill/asciinema.org))

      If technical details interest you then read more about
      [how it works](#{docs_path('how-it-works')}).

      ## A bit of a history

      Asciinema project was started by <a href="/~sickill">Marcin Kulik</a> 
      ([@sickill](https://twitter.com/sickill)) in the beginning of 2011 as
      ascii.io.  He was playing with the idea of sharing terminal session
      recordings on the web since 2010 but the working prototype came to life a bit
      later. asciinema.org site had a first public release in March 2012 (as
      ascii.io then). The project was renamed to Asciinema in September 2013.

      Asciinema is actively developed with the help of great open
      source [contributors](https://github.com/sickill/asciinema.org/contributors).

      ## Reporting bugs

      As the service is built of 2 parts there are 2 separate bug trackers:

      * [github.com/sickill/asciinema.org/issues](https://github.com/sickill/asciinema.org/issues) - for the website / player / embedding issues and ideas,
      * [github.com/sickill/asciinema/issues](https://github.com/sickill/asciinema/issues) - for the recorder issues and ideas.

      Please only use them for reporting bugs and submitting feature requests.
      Do not ask for general help there. Use IRC or the support email for that.
