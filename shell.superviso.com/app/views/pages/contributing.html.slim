    p
      ' Asciinema is open-source software and the service at asciinema.org is
        made available free of charge to anyone. A lot of effort is put in this
        project and it's developed exclusively in free time. If you find the
        service useful, you think it's a great idea or you believe in giving
        back to the open-source community please consider making a financial
        donation or putting your time to improve the project.

    p
      ' Supporting an open-source project feels great. And you can do it in
        many ways. Here is a list of a few things you can do to show your
        appreciation and help Asciinema.

    h2 id="donating" Donating

    p
      ' While the service is free of charge for anyone it still requires
        servers, domains, SSL certificates, storage for backups and other
        resources to keep it running.

    p
      ' Consider a donation to help cover these costs. Be it once, be it
        regularly, be it a small or a big amount. Even if it's just
        enough for "a beer", your support helps running the service and
        motivates future developments.

    p
      ' You can choose from several options below to support Asciinema financially.

    h3 Bitcoin

    p
      ' Currently Asciinema recorder can be installed on any Linux, OS X and
        FreeBSD system with <code>pip</code> (because it's a Python package at
        its core).  There are also native packages for Ubuntu and Arch Linux at
        the moment.

    p
      ' If you use an operating system for which there's no native asciinema
        package and you know how to build one then don't hesitate, build it and
        let us know.
