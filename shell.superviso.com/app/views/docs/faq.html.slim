  # Frequently Asked Questions

  ## Can I embed the asciicast player on my blog?

    Sure, see [embedding docs](#{docs_path(:embedding)}).

  ## How can I delete my asciicast?

  In order to delete your asciicast you need to associate your local API token
  (which was assigned to the recorded asciicast) with the asciinema.org
  account. Just run `asciinema auth` in your terminal and open the printed URL
  in your browser.  Once you sign in you'll see a "Delete" link on your
  asciicast's page.

  ## How can I point asciinema client to the custom asciinema instance?

  You can easily tell asciinema client to use custom API URL by adding
  following setting to _~/.asciinema/config_ file:

      [api]
      url = http://localhost:3000

  Alternatively, you can set `ASCIINEMA_API_URL` env variable:

      ASCIINEMA_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 asciinema rec

  ## Can I edit/post-process the recorded asciicast?

  TL;DR answer: No, you can't. Not yet.

  That's tricky. You can't do that at the moment. And there is a little chance
  asciinema will allow for this in the future. The thing is, the recording
  consists of two streams: text printed to the terminal and the timing
  information (how many characters to print after what delay). If you deleted
  some text from the first stream you would need to track the appropriate item
  in the second stream and adjust the number of characters for it. Otherwise
  the replay of the asciicast would get broken and just look improper.

  Also, some characters in the text stream are not printable characters, they
  are escape sequences used to change the text foreground and background color,
  erase some areas of the terminal etc. Each sequence depends on the state of
  the terminal at a given moment. By (accidently) removing these sequences you
  could break the whole output so it would display mostly rubbish.
