  # Embedding the player

  The asciicasts can easily be embedded on any HTML page. If you want
  to put the recording in your blog post, in your project's documentation or
  in your conference talk slides you can do it by copy-pasting the embed
  script.

  You can find the embed script on the asciicast's page. It looks like this:

      <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/14.js" id="asciicast-14" async></script>

  The player shows up right at the place where the script is pasted. Let's look
  at the following markup:

      <p>This is some text.</p>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/14.js" id="asciicast-14" async></script>
      <p>This is some other text.</p>

  The player will show up as a `div` element with a class "asciicast" between
  the two paragraphs.

  ## Customizing the player

  The embed script supports several customization options. An option can be
  applied by adding it as a
  <code>data-<em>option-name</em>="<em>option-value</em>"</code> attribute to
  the script tag.

  ### speed

  The `speed` option alters the playback speed. The default speed is 1 which
  means it plays at the unaltered, original speed.

  For example, to make the playback 2 times faster than original recording the
  script should look like this:

      <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/14.js" id="asciicast-14" async data-speed="2"></script>

  ### size

  The `size` option alters the size of the terminal font. There are 3 available
  sizes:

  * small (default)
  * medium
  * big

  For example, to make the font big the script should look like this:

      <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/14.js" id="asciicast-14" async data-size="big"></script>

  ### autoplay

  The `autoplay` option allows for automatic playback start when the player
  loads. Accepted values:

  * 0 - do not start playback automatically (default)
  * 1 - start playback automatically

  For example, to make the asciicast auto play:

      <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/14.js" id="asciicast-14" async data-autoplay="1"></script>
