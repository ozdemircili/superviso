What is Superviso?


With everyday passing we are bound to user more application, see more statistics, 
compare more and more metrics. Superviso is a dashboard and monitorization system 
that is developed to solve the problem of having various data on different applications and different view. 
We can make sense of data in comparison and the best way to compare passes in seeing the big picture in the
same format and in the same environment. So Superviso comes into play where the managers, workers need to see
various metrics that are valuable to them.

Feel free to shoot me an email to ask anything or just fork and use it for your business.


The usage stories typically are:

- Getting different types of data (database sql queries, load metrics from servers, 
financial sales status, earnings, or any other data necessary) and displaying them using 
the 14 different types of widget styles and distributing them on different dashboards.
- Creating different dashboards for different departments in your workplace and displaying 
them on large screens (Financial data for accounting department, jenkins and continious delivery 
status and svn stats for IT developers, or network statistics for network department)
- Creating meaningfull dashboards for managers and leaders which gives them the "overall" view of 
what is going on in their department / company.
